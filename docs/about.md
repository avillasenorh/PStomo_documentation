# About PStomo

PStomo is a seismic tomography program written in C that inverts first-arriving P (and S) wave
arrival times to obtain a P (and S) wave velocity model. PStomo can use any combination
of controlled sources (e.g. explosions) and natural sources (earthquakes). When using earthquakes,
PStomo can jointly invert both for velocity structure and earthquake relocation.

## Authors

The current version of PStomo has been developed by Ari Tryggvason,
Department of Earth Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.

The original program was created by Harley M. Benz at the U.S. Geological Survey.
The finite difference algorithms were written by John Vidale, John Hole,
Pascal Podvin and Isabel Lecomte (see the reference list).
The (modified) LSQR algorithm was created by Paige and Saunders (1982).
The (slightly modified) SVD algorithms are taken from Numerical Recipes in C (Press et al., 1988).

Yao Zheng Shen created the algorithms for generating the output for computing the
resolution matrix with LSQR (Yao, et al., 1999).

Antonio Villase√±or created initial versions of some of the GMT scripts used in the tutorial examples.
